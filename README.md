# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## MODULE 17 SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

### OVERVIEW
You are assisting Jill, the lead Data Scientist at FAST LENDING a lending services company whose management wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk as they believe this will provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience by more accurately identifying good candidates for loans which in turn will lead to lower default rates.  This will be accomplished by using several different Machine Learning models, algorithms and techniques.

### NEW TOOLS
* Scikit-learn LIBRARY

### LIST OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
* LOGISTIC REGRESSION
* SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
* DECISION TREE MODEL
* RANDOM FOREST MODEL

### ML TECHNIQUES:
* F1 SCORE (aka HARMONIC MEAN) = 2 (PRECISION * SENSITIVITY) / (PRECISION + SENSITIVITY)
* PRECISION (aka POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE) = TRUE POSITIVE/(TRUE POSITIVE + FALSE POSITIVE)
* SENSITIVITY (aka RECALL) = TRUE POSITIVE/(TRUE POSITIVE + FALSE NEGATIVE)
* BOOTSTRAP AGGREGATION (aka BAGGING)
* BOOSTING (ADAPTIVE and GRADIENT)
* RANDOM OVERSAMPLING
* SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVERSAMPLING TECHNIQUE (aka SMOTE)
* RANDOM UNDERSAMPLING
* SMOTEENN (SMOTE + EDITED NEAREST NEIGHBORS algorithmn)
